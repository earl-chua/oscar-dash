# Academy Award Big Eight Prediction Dashboard

## About the Application

How do you predict the Oscars? There is plenty of information available beforehand, but it's hard to organize them together (not as hard as an NCAA bracket).
Most ballots rely on hunches, can be susceptible to recency bias (<i>"They won the BAFTAs so..."</i>), and may boil down to a form of wishcasting. A way to correct
this is to add some structure, and one way to add structure is to look at some strategies people use to fill up their ballots.

Strategies vary from simply tracking other awards shows to looking at analytical models, and this application is a way to see how well you would've done
 retroactively, year on year. At this current iteration, you get to see how the strategies have performed. Future iterations could include leaderboards, where users
 submit their predictions <i>before</i> the Oscars and get evaluated after the fact. In putting this together, hopefully users gain a better sense of how 
 awards voters make their picks, and will stop being shocked at otherwise-"predictable" results.
