<h1> Overview of Ballot Strategies </h1>
 
<h2> Golden Globes </h2>
<p> The first major awards show of the season. The Golden Globes provide the first piece of information for mainstream audiences. 
For this application, since some film categories are partitioned into Drama and Musical/Comedy we have two strategies:
 one with a Drama bias and another with a Musical/Comedy bias.</p>

<h2> BAFTAs </h2>
<p> The UK's biggest awards show. It has been the bellweather for several upsets like 
Olivia Colman's Best Actress win for <i>The Favourite</i> and 
Anthony Hopkins' Best Actor win for <i>The Father</i>. </p>

<h2> Guilds </h2>
<p> Picking winners based on their respective guilds (e.g., Screen Actors' Guild for the acting awards). The core rationale here is that
the voting populations are similar (since they cover, in theory, the same group of people), which makes this
 one of the most reliable indicators. </p>

<h2> Odds </h2>
<p> Based on odds just before the betting market closed. Platforms will have some variation, but here, we are using the
<a href="https://www.sportsoddshistory.com/other/academy-awards-odds/">SportsBookOdds archive</a> 
for Picture, Directing, and the Acting Awards. We will be using various sources for the Screenplay awards.</p>

<h2> GoldDerby Users </h2>
<p> Wisdom of the Crowds! <a href="https://www.goldderby.com/">GoldDerby</a> is a community of fans and experts that predict Hollywood races,
from the Oscars to the Emmys to reality TV.</p>

<h2> Oscarmetrics </h2>
<p> Mathematician and current New York Mets Director of Analytics Ben Zauzmer developed a data-driven approach to predicting the Oscars, outlined in his book
 <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oscarmetrics-Behind-Biggest-Night-Hollywood/dp/1629334405">Oscarmetrics</a></i>. </p>

<h2> Other Strategies </h2>
Besides using other awards shows (such as the Critics' Choice Awards), FiveThirtyEight has compiled a series of
<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/oscars-predictions-2016/">interesting strategies</a> that have not been included in the 
application so far, but will be soon!

<h3> Note </h3>
<p> By virtue of how nominations work, some winners in pre-Oscars shows do not get nominated for an Oscar (e.g. Ben Affleck for Directing in
 <i>Argo</i>). In such a case, for illustrative purposes, a nominee of both the said pre-Oscar show and the Oscars will be chosen at random. If none are Oscar-nominated,
 a nominee will be chosen at random. Additionally, some awards shows have ties; a winner will be chosen at random. </p>
